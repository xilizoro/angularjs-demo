testing
================

This is the testing demostration for unit testing in AngularJS. The application utilizing Karma as the test runner and Mocha, Chai, Sinon as testing libraries. In order to run the application testing suites, do the following:

### Checkout `karma.config.js`

This file can be automagically generated by typing karma init in a terminal window. The available keys are described in [Karmaâ€™s documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/config/configuration-file.html)

Notice how sources and test files are declared. There is also a newcomer: [ngMock](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock) (i.e. `angular-mocks.js`). ngMock is an AngularJS module that provides several testing utilities

### Install necessary packages

Before executing any tests or any part of the application, make sure to get all the dependencies from Npm and Bower by running

```
npm install && bower install
```

### Run the test command

```
./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
```

This will bootstrap Karma and output results from test suites and subsuites in the CLI. Check console for more information on what socket the app is running, the testing coverage summary, and whether the tests are correct or false
